# UFOs

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to create a website that takes user inputs and filters through data of UFO sightings. To accomplish this task, we used HTML, CSS and Javascript. The interactive website can be found at the following link: 

https://rcookie23.github.io/UFOs/

## Results 

In order to use this webpage, a user can enter inputs into the filter fields and the UFO data will be sorted accordingly. The Top part of the web page looks like the following: 

![top_of_page](/static/images/top_of_page.png)

If the user scrolls down, they will see top of the data set and the filter options, which look like this: 

![ds_empty](/static/images/ds_empty.png)

To filter the data, the user should enter parameters into the filters consistent with the placeholder text in the input box. An example of a filtered search is shown below: 

![filtered_search](/static/images/filtered_search.png)

## Summmary

One drawback of this webpage is that the filter inputs have to be very specific in order for the filters to work. The letters must be in all lowercase, and the user must know the correct abbreviations for each state and country. It would be beneficial to allow the page to filter inputs regardless of capitalization. 

Suggestions for further development: 
1. Add a filter that allows the user to search by duration. 
2. Update the dataset with more recent UFO data.
